# This script downloads and installs:
#  - micromamba to ~/.local/bin/micromamba (for fast Conda environment management)
#  - uv to ~/.local/bin/uv (for fast pip installations)
#  - unidep (to manage unified Conda and Pip dependencies)
#
# UniDep streamlines Python project dependency management by combining both Conda
# and Pip dependencies into a single system. For more information, visit:

# If you prefer to run the commands manually, you can execute each section one by one.
# Otherwise, piping this script directly to bash ensures everything is installed in one go.
